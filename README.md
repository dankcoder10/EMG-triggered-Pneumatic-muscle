# EMG-triggered-Servo-Motor
The project is the basic implementation of prosthetics for those who might have lost half of their limbs. It uses EMG sensors combined with arduino to actuate artificial-pneumatic muscle based on muscle signals. It uses electro-pneumatics to combine 5V arduino with 24V pneumatic muscle.
